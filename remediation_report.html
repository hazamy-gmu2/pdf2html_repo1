This UI works in conjunction with the backend PDF Accessibility project to provide a complete solution for PDF accessibility remediation.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:1.AWS Accountwith appropriate permissions to create resources2. (version or later)Node.js14.x3.AWS CLIinstalled and configured with appropriate credentials4.AWS CDK CLIinstalled (npm install -g aws-cdk)5.Gitfor version control6.Pythonfor Lambda functions3.97.GitHub Personal Access Tokenwith repository access permissions8.Backend Deployment -The project must be deployed firstPDF Accessibility_(https://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF Accessibility)Step 1: Deploy the Backend PDF Accessibility ProjectBefore deploying this UI, you must first deploy the backend PDF Accessibility project:1. Clone the backend repository:git clonehttps://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_Accessibility.gitcd PDF_Accessibility2. Follow the installation instructions in the backend repository to deploy it completely.3.Important:Take note of the S3 bucket name created during the backend deployment. You will need this for the UI deployment.Step 2: Clone the UI Repository1. Clone this repository:git clonehttps://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_accessability_UI.gitcd PDF_accessability_UIStep 3: Install Dependencies1. Install backend dependencies:cd cdk_backend npm install2. Install frontend dependencies:cd ./pdf_ui\n\nnpm installStep 4: Configure and Deploy the CDK Backend1. Return to the cdk_backend directory:\n\ncd ../cdk_backend\n\n2. Modify the domain prefix in the CDK stack:\n\nOpen the file dk_backend/lib/cdk_backend-stack.ts and locate this line:\n\nconst domainPrefix = 'pdf-ui-auth'; // must be globally unique in that region\n\nChange pdf-ui-auth to a unique name of your choice. This domain prefix must be globally unique within the AWS region you're deploying\n\nto.\n\n3. Bootstrap your AWS environment (if not already done):\n\ncdk bootstrap -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c PebucketName=<s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment>\n\n4. Deploy the infrastructure:\n\ncdk deploy -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c bucketName=<s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment>\n\nReplace:\n\n<your-github-token> with your GitHub Personal Access Token\n <s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment> with the S3 bucket name from the backend deployment\n\n5. The deployment will create several AWS resources including:\n\nCognito User Pool and Identity Pool\n Amplify application for hosting the UI\n IAM roles and policies\n Lambda functions for user management\n\n6. Take note of the outputs from the CDK deployment, especially the Amplify app URL.Step 5: Configure S3 Bucket CORS SettingsAfter deployment, you need to configure CORS settings for the S3 bucket to allow cross-origin requests from the UI:1. Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to S3 service3. Select the S3 bucket that was created during the backend deployment4. Click on the \"Permissions\" tab5. Scroll down to the \"Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\" section6. Click \"Edit\" and add the following CORS configuration:[ { \"AllowedHeaders\" : [ \"\"\" ], \"AllowedMethods\" : [ \"GET\", \"HEAD\", \"PUT\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\" 1, \"AllowedOrigins\": [ \"\"\" ], \"ExposeHeaders\" : [] } ]7. Click \"Save changes\"Step 6: Configure AWS Amplify Redirect and Rewrite RulesAfter the Amplify app is deployed, you need to configure redirect and rewrite rules:1. Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to AWS Amplify service3. Select your newly deployed application4. Go to \"Hosting\" \"Rewrites and redirects\"5. Delete any existing rules6. Add the following rules:[\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"301\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/home\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/callback\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/app\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n}\t\t\n]Important Note:These rules need to be added AFTER the application is done building. If you need to deploy a new update, you should:1. Delete these rules2. Deploy the update3. Re-add these rules after the build is completeStep 7: Testing the Deployment1. Access your application using the Amplify app URL (from the CDK deployment outputs)2. You should see the login page for the PDF Accessibility Remediation UI3. Create a new account or sign in with existing credentials4. Upload a PDF file to test the accessibility remediation processTroubleshooting Authentication IssuesIf you encounter \"No matching state found\" errors:Clear browser cookies and cacheEnsure correct Cognito configuration in environment variablesCheck redirect URIs in Cognito user pool client settingsUpload FailuresCheck file size limits in user attributesVerify S3 bucket permissionsCheck CORS configuration on the S3 bucketPDF Processing ErrorsCheck CloudWatch logs for Lambda functionsVerify Adobe API credentialsMonitor ECS task statusAmplify Deployment IssuesIf the application doesn't load correctly, verify the redirect and rewrite rulesCheck the Amplify build logs for any errorsEnsure the GitHub token has the necessary permissionsAdditional ConfigurationCustom Domain (Optional)If you want to use a custom domain for your application:1. Go to the AWS Amplify console2. Select your application3. Go to \"Domain management\"4. Follow the instructions to add and verify your domainUser ManagementBy default, the application creates three user groups:DefaultUsers: Regular users with standard permissionsAmazonUsers: Users with Amazon email addressesAdminUsers: Users with administrative privilegesTo manage users and their permissions:1. Go to the AWS Cognito console2. Select the user pool created for this application3. Navigate to \"Users and groups\" to manage users and their group membershipsSecurity ConsiderationsThe CORS configuration provided allows requests from any origin (*). For production environments, you should restrict this to specific domains.Review the IAM roles and permissions created by the CDK deployment to ensure they follow the principle of least privilege.Consider implementing additional security measures such as WAF rules for the Amplify application.Maintenance and UpdatesWhen updating the application:1. Make your changes to the code2. For frontend changes:cd pdf_ui npm run build3. For backend changes, redeploy the CDK stack:cd cdk_backend cdk deploy -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c bucketName=<s3-bucket-name>4.

This UI works in conjunction with the backend PDF Accessibility project to provide a complete solution for PDF accessibility remediation.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:1.AWS Accountwith appropriate permissions to create resources2. (version or later)Node.js14.x3.AWS CLIinstalled and configured with appropriate credentials4.AWS CDK CLIinstalled (npm install -g aws-cdk)5.Gitfor version control6.Pythonfor Lambda functions3.97.GitHub Personal Access Tokenwith repository access permissions8.Backend Deployment -The project must be deployed firstPDF Accessibility_(https://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF Accessibility)Step 1: Deploy the Backend PDF Accessibility ProjectBefore deploying this UI, you must first deploy the backend PDF Accessibility project:1. Clone the backend repository:git clonehttps://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_Accessibility.gitcd PDF_Accessibility2. Follow the installation instructions in the backend repository to deploy it completely.3.Important:Take note of the S3 bucket name created during the backend deployment. You will need this for the UI deployment.Step 2: Clone the UI Repository1. Clone this repository:git clonehttps://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_accessability_UI.gitcd PDF_accessability_UIStep 3: Install Dependencies1. Install backend dependencies:cd cdk_backend npm install2. Install frontend dependencies:cd ./pdf_ui\n\nnpm installStep 4: Configure and Deploy the CDK Backend1. Return to the cdk_backend directory:\n\ncd ../cdk_backend\n\n2. Modify the domain prefix in the CDK stack:\n\nOpen the file dk_backend/lib/cdk_backend-stack.ts and locate this line:\n\nconst domainPrefix = 'pdf-ui-auth'; // must be globally unique in that region\n\nChange pdf-ui-auth to a unique name of your choice. This domain prefix must be globally unique within the AWS region you're deploying\n\nto.\n\n3. Bootstrap your AWS environment (if not already done):\n\ncdk bootstrap -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c PebucketName=<s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment>\n\n4. Deploy the infrastructure:\n\ncdk deploy -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c bucketName=<s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment>\n\nReplace:\n\n<your-github-token> with your GitHub Personal Access Token\n <s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment> with the S3 bucket name from the backend deployment\n\n5. The deployment will create several AWS resources including:\n\nCognito User Pool and Identity Pool\n Amplify application for hosting the UI\n IAM roles and policies\n Lambda functions for user management\n\n6. Take note of the outputs from the CDK deployment, especially the Amplify app URL.Step 5: Configure S3 Bucket CORS SettingsAfter deployment, you need to configure CORS settings for the S3 bucket to allow cross-origin requests from the UI:1. Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to S3 service3. Select the S3 bucket that was created during the backend deployment4. Click on the \"Permissions\" tab5. Scroll down to the \"Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\" section6. Click \"Edit\" and add the following CORS configuration:[ { \"AllowedHeaders\" : [ \"\"\" ], \"AllowedMethods\" : [ \"GET\", \"HEAD\", \"PUT\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\" 1, \"AllowedOrigins\": [ \"\"\" ], \"ExposeHeaders\" : [] } ]7. Click \"Save changes\"Step 6: Configure AWS Amplify Redirect and Rewrite RulesAfter the Amplify app is deployed, you need to configure redirect and rewrite rules:1. Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to AWS Amplify service3. Select your newly deployed application4. Go to \"Hosting\" \"Rewrites and redirects\"5. Delete any existing rules6. Add the following rules:[\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"301\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/home\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/callback\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/app\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n}\t\t\n]Important Note:These rules need to be added AFTER the application is done building. If you need to deploy a new update, you should:1. Delete these rules2. Deploy the update3. Re-add these rules after the build is completeStep 7: Testing the Deployment1.

            "text_content": "PDF Accessibility Remediation UI - Installation GuideThis guide provides detailed instructions for deploying the PDF Accessibility Remediation UI in your environment. This UI works in conjunction with the backend PDF Accessibility project to provide a complete solution for PDF accessibility remediation.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:1.AWS Accountwith appropriate permissions to create resources2. (version or later)Node.js14.x3.AWS CLIinstalled and configured with appropriate credentials4.AWS CDK CLIinstalled (npm install -g aws-cdk)5.Gitfor version control6.Pythonfor Lambda functions3.97.GitHub Personal Access Tokenwith repository access permissions8.Backend Deployment -The project must be deployed firstPDF Accessibility_(https://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF Accessibility)Step 1: Deploy the Backend PDF Accessibility ProjectBefore deploying this UI, you must first deploy the backend PDF Accessibility project:1. Clone the backend repository:git clonehttps://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_Accessibility.gitcd PDF_Accessibility2. Follow the installation instructions in the backend repository to deploy it completely.3.Important:Take note of the S3 bucket name created during the backend deployment. You will need this for the UI deployment.Step 2: Clone the UI Repository1. Clone this repository:git clonehttps://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_accessability_UI.gitcd PDF_accessability_UIStep 3: Install Dependencies1. Install backend dependencies:cd cdk_backend npm install2. Install frontend dependencies:cd ./pdf_ui\n\nnpm installStep 4: Configure and Deploy the CDK Backend1. Return to the cdk_backend directory:\n\ncd ../cdk_backend\n\n2. Modify the domain prefix in the CDK stack:\n\nOpen the file dk_backend/lib/cdk_backend-stack.ts and locate this line:\n\nconst domainPrefix = 'pdf-ui-auth'; // must be globally unique in that region\n\nChange pdf-ui-auth to a unique name of your choice. This domain prefix must be globally unique within the AWS region you're deploying\n\nto.\n\n3. Bootstrap your AWS environment (if not already done):\n\ncdk bootstrap -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c PebucketName=<s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment>\n\n4. Deploy the infrastructure:\n\ncdk deploy -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c bucketName=<s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment>\n\nReplace:\n\n<your-github-token> with your GitHub Personal Access Token\n <s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment> with the S3 bucket name from the backend deployment\n\n5. The deployment will create several AWS resources including:\n\nCognito User Pool and Identity Pool\n Amplify application for hosting the UI\n IAM roles and policies\n Lambda functions for user management\n\n6. Take note of the outputs from the CDK deployment, especially the Amplify app URL.Step 5: Configure S3 Bucket CORS SettingsAfter deployment, you need to configure CORS settings for the S3 bucket to allow cross-origin requests from the UI:1. Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to S3 service3. Select the S3 bucket that was created during the backend deployment4. Click on the \"Permissions\" tab5. Scroll down to the \"Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\" section6. Click \"Edit\" and add the following CORS configuration:[ { \"AllowedHeaders\" : [ \"\"\" ], \"AllowedMethods\" : [ \"GET\", \"HEAD\", \"PUT\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\" 1, \"AllowedOrigins\": [ \"\"\" ], \"ExposeHeaders\" : [] } ]7. Click \"Save changes\"Step 6: Configure AWS Amplify Redirect and Rewrite RulesAfter the Amplify app is deployed, you need to configure redirect and rewrite rules:1. Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to AWS Amplify service3. Select your newly deployed application4. Go to \"Hosting\" \"Rewrites and redirects\"5. Delete any existing rules6. Add the following rules:[\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"301\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/home\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/callback\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/app\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n}\t\t\n]Important Note:These rules need to be added AFTER the application is done building. If you need to deploy a new update, you should:1. Delete these rules2. Deploy the update3. Re-add these rules after the build is completeStep 7: Testing the Deployment1. Access your application using the Amplify app URL (from the CDK deployment outputs)2. You should see the login page for the PDF Accessibility Remediation UI3. Create a new account or sign in with existing credentials4. Upload a PDF file to test the accessibility remediation processTroubleshooting Authentication IssuesIf you encounter \"No matching state found\" errors:Clear browser cookies and cacheEnsure correct Cognito configuration in environment variablesCheck redirect URIs in Cognito user pool client settingsUpload FailuresCheck file size limits in user attributesVerify S3 bucket permissionsCheck CORS configuration on the S3 bucketPDF Processing ErrorsCheck CloudWatch logs for Lambda functionsVerify Adobe API credentialsMonitor ECS task statusAmplify Deployment IssuesIf the application doesn't load correctly, verify the redirect and rewrite rulesCheck the Amplify build logs for any errorsEnsure the GitHub token has the necessary permissionsAdditional ConfigurationCustom Domain (Optional)If you want to use a custom domain for your application:1. Go to the AWS Amplify console2. Select your application3. Go to \"Domain management\"4. Follow the instructions to add and verify your domainUser ManagementBy default, the application creates three user groups:DefaultUsers: Regular users with standard permissionsAmazonUsers: Users with Amazon email addressesAdminUsers: Users with administrative privilegesTo manage users and their permissions:1. Go to the AWS Cognito console2. Select the user pool created for this application3. Navigate to \"Users and groups\" to manage users and their group membershipsSecurity ConsiderationsThe CORS configuration provided allows requests from any origin (*). For production environments, you should restrict this to specific domains.Review the IAM roles and permissions created by the CDK deployment to ensure they follow the principle of least privilege.Consider implementing additional security measures such as WAF rules for the Amplify application.Maintenance and UpdatesWhen updating the application:1. Make your changes to the code2. For frontend changes:cd pdf_ui npm run build3. For backend changes, redeploy the CDK stack:cd cdk_backend cdk deploy -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c bucketName=<s3-bucket-name>4. Remember to reconfigure the Amplify redirect and rewrite rules after each deploymentSupportIf you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.",

Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to S3 service3. Select the S3 bucket that was created during the backend deployment4. Click on the \"Permissions\" tab5. Scroll down to the \"Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\" section6. Click \"Edit\" and add the following CORS configuration:[ { \"AllowedHeaders\" : [ \"\"\" ], \"AllowedMethods\" : [ \"GET\", \"HEAD\", \"PUT\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\" 1, \"AllowedOrigins\": [ \"\"\" ], \"ExposeHeaders\" : [] } ]7. Click \"Save changes\"Step 6: Configure AWS Amplify Redirect and Rewrite RulesAfter the Amplify app is deployed, you need to configure redirect and rewrite rules:1. Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to AWS Amplify service3. Select your newly deployed application4. Go to \"Hosting\" \"Rewrites and redirects\"5. Delete any existing rules6. Add the following rules:[\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"301\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/home\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/callback\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/app\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n}\t\t\n]Important Note:These rules need to be added AFTER the application is done building. If you need to deploy a new update, you should:1. Delete these rules2. Deploy the update3. Re-add these rules after the build is completeStep 7: Testing the Deployment1. Access your application using the Amplify app URL (from the CDK deployment outputs)2. You should see the login page for the PDF Accessibility Remediation UI3. Create a new account or sign in with existing credentials4. Upload a PDF file to test the accessibility remediation processTroubleshooting Authentication IssuesIf you encounter \"No matching state found\" errors:Clear browser cookies and cacheEnsure correct Cognito configuration in environment variablesCheck redirect URIs in Cognito user pool client settingsUpload FailuresCheck file size limits in user attributesVerify S3 bucket permissionsCheck CORS configuration on the S3 bucketPDF Processing ErrorsCheck CloudWatch logs for Lambda functionsVerify Adobe API credentialsMonitor ECS task statusAmplify Deployment IssuesIf the application doesn't load correctly, verify the redirect and rewrite rulesCheck the Amplify build logs for any errorsEnsure the GitHub token has the necessary permissionsAdditional ConfigurationCustom Domain (Optional)If you want to use a custom domain for your application:1. Go to the AWS Amplify console2. Select your application3. Go to \"Domain management\"4. Follow the instructions to add and verify your domainUser ManagementBy default, the application creates three user groups:DefaultUsers: Regular users with standard permissionsAmazonUsers: Users with Amazon email addressesAdminUsers: Users with administrative privilegesTo manage users and their permissions:1. Go to the AWS Cognito console2. Select the user pool created for this application3. Navigate to \"Users and groups\" to manage users and their group membershipsSecurity ConsiderationsThe CORS configuration provided allows requests from any origin (*). For production environments, you should restrict this to specific domains.Review the IAM roles and permissions created by the CDK deployment to ensure they follow the principle of least privilege.Consider implementing additional security measures such as WAF rules for the Amplify application.Maintenance and UpdatesWhen updating the application:1. Make your changes to the code2. For frontend changes:cd pdf_ui npm run build3. For backend changes, redeploy the CDK stack:cd cdk_backend cdk deploy -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c bucketName=<s3-bucket-name>4. Remember to reconfigure the Amplify redirect and rewrite rules after each deploymentSupportIf you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.",

Add the following rules:[\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"301\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/home\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/callback\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/app\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n}\t\t\n]Important Note:These rules need to be added AFTER the application is done building. If you need to deploy a new update, you should:1. Delete these rules2. Deploy the update3. Re-add these rules after the build is completeStep 7: Testing the Deployment1. Access your application using the Amplify app URL (from the CDK deployment outputs)2. You should see the login page for the PDF Accessibility Remediation UI3. Create a new account or sign in with existing credentials4. Upload a PDF file to test the accessibility remediation processTroubleshooting Authentication IssuesIf you encounter \"No matching state found\" errors:Clear browser cookies and cacheEnsure correct Cognito configuration in environment variablesCheck redirect URIs in Cognito user pool client settingsUpload FailuresCheck file size limits in user attributesVerify S3 bucket permissionsCheck CORS configuration on the S3 bucketPDF Processing ErrorsCheck CloudWatch logs for Lambda functionsVerify Adobe API credentialsMonitor ECS task statusAmplify Deployment IssuesIf the application doesn't load correctly, verify the redirect and rewrite rulesCheck the Amplify build logs for any errorsEnsure the GitHub token has the necessary permissionsAdditional ConfigurationCustom Domain (Optional)If you want to use a custom domain for your application:1. Go to the AWS Amplify console2. Select your application3. Go to \"Domain management\"4. Follow the instructions to add and verify your domainUser ManagementBy default, the application creates three user groups:DefaultUsers: Regular users with standard permissionsAmazonUsers: Users with Amazon email addressesAdminUsers: Users with administrative privilegesTo manage users and their permissions:1. Go to the AWS Cognito console2. Select the user pool created for this application3. Navigate to \"Users and groups\" to manage users and their group membershipsSecurity ConsiderationsThe CORS configuration provided allows requests from any origin (*). For production environments, you should restrict this to specific domains.Review the IAM roles and permissions created by the CDK deployment to ensure they follow the principle of least privilege.Consider implementing additional security measures such as WAF rules for the Amplify application.Maintenance and UpdatesWhen updating the application:1. Make your changes to the code2. For frontend changes:cd pdf_ui npm run build3. For backend changes, redeploy the CDK stack:cd cdk_backend cdk deploy -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c bucketName=<s3-bucket-name>4. Remember to reconfigure the Amplify redirect and rewrite rules after each deploymentSupportIf you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.",

        "text_content": "PDF Accessibility Remediation UI - Installation GuideThis guide provides detailed instructions for deploying the PDF Accessibility Remediation UI in your environment. This UI works in conjunction with the backend PDF Accessibility project to provide a complete solution for PDF accessibility remediation.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:1.AWS Accountwith appropriate permissions to create resources2. (version or later)Node.js14.x3.AWS CLIinstalled and configured with appropriate credentials4.AWS CDK CLIinstalled (npm install -g aws-cdk)5.Gitfor version control6.Pythonfor Lambda functions3.97.GitHub Personal Access Tokenwith repository access permissions8.Backend Deployment -The project must be deployed firstPDF Accessibility_(https://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF Accessibility)Step 1: Deploy the Backend PDF Accessibility ProjectBefore deploying this UI, you must first deploy the backend PDF Accessibility project:1. Clone the backend repository:git clonehttps://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_Accessibility.gitcd PDF_Accessibility2. Follow the installation instructions in the backend repository to deploy it completely.3.Important:Take note of the S3 bucket name created during the backend deployment. You will need this for the UI deployment.Step 2: Clone the UI Repository1. Clone this repository:git clonehttps://github.com/ASUCICREPO/PDF_accessability_UI.gitcd PDF_accessability_UIStep 3: Install Dependencies1. Install backend dependencies:cd cdk_backend npm install2. Install frontend dependencies:cd ./pdf_ui\n\nnpm installStep 4: Configure and Deploy the CDK Backend1. Return to the cdk_backend directory:\n\ncd ../cdk_backend\n\n2. Modify the domain prefix in the CDK stack:\n\nOpen the file dk_backend/lib/cdk_backend-stack.ts and locate this line:\n\nconst domainPrefix = 'pdf-ui-auth'; // must be globally unique in that region\n\nChange pdf-ui-auth to a unique name of your choice. This domain prefix must be globally unique within the AWS region you're deploying\n\nto.\n\n3. Bootstrap your AWS environment (if not already done):\n\ncdk bootstrap -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c PebucketName=<s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment>\n\n4. Deploy the infrastructure:\n\ncdk deploy -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c bucketName=<s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment>\n\nReplace:\n\n<your-github-token> with your GitHub Personal Access Token\n <s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment> with the S3 bucket name from the backend deployment\n\n5. The deployment will create several AWS resources including:\n\nCognito User Pool and Identity Pool\n Amplify application for hosting the UI\n IAM roles and policies\n Lambda functions for user management\n\n6. Take note of the outputs from the CDK deployment, especially the Amplify app URL.Step 5: Configure S3 Bucket CORS SettingsAfter deployment, you need to configure CORS settings for the S3 bucket to allow cross-origin requests from the UI:1. Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to S3 service3. Select the S3 bucket that was created during the backend deployment4. Click on the \"Permissions\" tab5. Scroll down to the \"Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\" section6. Click \"Edit\" and add the following CORS configuration:[ { \"AllowedHeaders\" : [ \"\"\" ], \"AllowedMethods\" : [ \"GET\", \"HEAD\", \"PUT\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\" 1, \"AllowedOrigins\": [ \"\"\" ], \"ExposeHeaders\" : [] } ]7. Click \"Save changes\"Step 6: Configure AWS Amplify Redirect and Rewrite RulesAfter the Amplify app is deployed, you need to configure redirect and rewrite rules:1. Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to AWS Amplify service3. Select your newly deployed application4. Go to \"Hosting\" \"Rewrites and redirects\"5. Delete any existing rules6. Add the following rules:[\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"301\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/home\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/callback\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/app\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n}\t\t\n]Important Note:These rules need to be added AFTER the application is done building. If you need to deploy a new update, you should:1. Delete these rules2. Deploy the update3. Re-add these rules after the build is completeStep 7: Testing the Deployment1. Access your application using the Amplify app URL (from the CDK deployment outputs)2. You should see the login page for the PDF Accessibility Remediation UI3. Create a new account or sign in with existing credentials4. Upload a PDF file to test the accessibility remediation processTroubleshooting Authentication IssuesIf you encounter \"No matching state found\" errors:Clear browser cookies and cacheEnsure correct Cognito configuration in environment variablesCheck redirect URIs in Cognito user pool client settingsUpload FailuresCheck file size limits in user attributesVerify S3 bucket permissionsCheck CORS configuration on the S3 bucketPDF Processing ErrorsCheck CloudWatch logs for Lambda functionsVerify Adobe API credentialsMonitor ECS task statusAmplify Deployment IssuesIf the application doesn't load correctly, verify the redirect and rewrite rulesCheck the Amplify build logs for any errorsEnsure the GitHub token has the necessary permissionsAdditional ConfigurationCustom Domain (Optional)If you want to use a custom domain for your application:1. Go to the AWS Amplify console2. Select your application3. Go to \"Domain management\"4. Follow the instructions to add and verify your domainUser ManagementBy default, the application creates three user groups:DefaultUsers: Regular users with standard permissionsAmazonUsers: Users with Amazon email addressesAdminUsers: Users with administrative privilegesTo manage users and their permissions:1. Go to the AWS Cognito console2. Select the user pool created for this application3. Navigate to \"Users and groups\" to manage users and their group membershipsSecurity ConsiderationsThe CORS configuration provided allows requests from any origin (*). For production environments, you should restrict this to specific domains.Review the IAM roles and permissions created by the CDK deployment to ensure they follow the principle of least privilege.Consider implementing additional security measures such as WAF rules for the Amplify application.Maintenance and UpdatesWhen updating the application:1. Make your changes to the code2. For frontend changes:cd pdf_ui npm run build3. For backend changes, redeploy the CDK stack:cd cdk_backend cdk deploy -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c bucketName=<s3-bucket-name>4. Remember to reconfigure the Amplify redirect and rewrite rules after each deploymentSupportIf you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.",

Deploy the infrastructure:\n\ncdk deploy -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c bucketName=<s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment>\n\nReplace:\n\n<your-github-token> with your GitHub Personal Access Token\n <s3-bucket-name-from-backend-deployment> with the S3 bucket name from the backend deployment\n\n5. The deployment will create several AWS resources including:\n\nCognito User Pool and Identity Pool\n Amplify application for hosting the UI\n IAM roles and policies\n Lambda functions for user management\n\n6. Take note of the outputs from the CDK deployment, especially the Amplify app URL.Step 5: Configure S3 Bucket CORS SettingsAfter deployment, you need to configure CORS settings for the S3 bucket to allow cross-origin requests from the UI:1. Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to S3 service3. Select the S3 bucket that was created during the backend deployment4. Click on the \"Permissions\" tab5. Scroll down to the \"Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\" section6. Click \"Edit\" and add the following CORS configuration:[ { \"AllowedHeaders\" : [ \"\"\" ], \"AllowedMethods\" : [ \"GET\", \"HEAD\", \"PUT\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\" 1, \"AllowedOrigins\": [ \"\"\" ], \"ExposeHeaders\" : [] } ]7. Click \"Save changes\"Step 6: Configure AWS Amplify Redirect and Rewrite RulesAfter the Amplify app is deployed, you need to configure redirect and rewrite rules:1. Go to the AWS Management Console2. Navigate to AWS Amplify service3. Select your newly deployed application4. Go to \"Hosting\" \"Rewrites and redirects\"5. Delete any existing rules6. Add the following rules:[\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"301\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/home\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/callback\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n},\t\t\n{\t\t\n\t\"source\": \"/app\",\t\n\t\"status\": \"200\",\t\n\t\"target\": \"/index.html\"\t\n}\t\t\n]Important Note:These rules need to be added AFTER the application is done building. If you need to deploy a new update, you should:1. Delete these rules2. Deploy the update3. Re-add these rules after the build is completeStep 7: Testing the Deployment1. Access your application using the Amplify app URL (from the CDK deployment outputs)2. You should see the login page for the PDF Accessibility Remediation UI3. Create a new account or sign in with existing credentials4. Upload a PDF file to test the accessibility remediation processTroubleshooting Authentication IssuesIf you encounter \"No matching state found\" errors:Clear browser cookies and cacheEnsure correct Cognito configuration in environment variablesCheck redirect URIs in Cognito user pool client settingsUpload FailuresCheck file size limits in user attributesVerify S3 bucket permissionsCheck CORS configuration on the S3 bucketPDF Processing ErrorsCheck CloudWatch logs for Lambda functionsVerify Adobe API credentialsMonitor ECS task statusAmplify Deployment IssuesIf the application doesn't load correctly, verify the redirect and rewrite rulesCheck the Amplify build logs for any errorsEnsure the GitHub token has the necessary permissionsAdditional ConfigurationCustom Domain (Optional)If you want to use a custom domain for your application:1. Go to the AWS Amplify console2. Select your application3. Go to \"Domain management\"4. Follow the instructions to add and verify your domainUser ManagementBy default, the application creates three user groups:DefaultUsers: Regular users with standard permissionsAmazonUsers: Users with Amazon email addressesAdminUsers: Users with administrative privilegesTo manage users and their permissions:1. Go to the AWS Cognito console2. Select the user pool created for this application3. Navigate to \"Users and groups\" to manage users and their group membershipsSecurity ConsiderationsThe CORS configuration provided allows requests from any origin (*). For production environments, you should restrict this to specific domains.Review the IAM roles and permissions created by the CDK deployment to ensure they follow the principle of least privilege.Consider implementing additional security measures such as WAF rules for the Amplify application.Maintenance and UpdatesWhen updating the application:1. Make your changes to the code2. For frontend changes:cd pdf_ui npm run build3. For backend changes, redeploy the CDK stack:cd cdk_backend cdk deploy -c githubToken=<your-github-token> -c bucketName=<s3-bucket-name>4. Remember to reconfigure the Amplify redirect and rewrite rules after each deploymentSupportIf you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.",
